# Tunnelling

Tunnelling is a remarkable quantum phenomenon that originates from the wave description of particles. As we have seen in the double slit experiment, a particle can be described as a wave; in particular, the mathematical tool used to do so is called the **wave function**.

## The Potential Barrier

The potential barrier is a perfect example to understand tunnelling.

It consists in a barrier of energy (called "potential"), which has a height of $V_0$ and a width of L. In classical mechanics, when a particle with energy $E < V_0$ hits the barrier, it does not have enough energy to classically surmount the barrier and reach the other side. 

## The Tunnelling Effect

In quantum mechanics, there is a nonzero probability of finding a particle on the other side of a potential barrier, a phenomenon known as **tunnelling effect**. Basically, we consider the particle in Region 1 that hits the barrier as an incident wave, described by a wave function $\psi_I(x)$, that will later divide in a transmitted part, $\psi_T(x)$, that goes through the barrier, and a reflected one, $\psi_R(x)$, that will rebound back.

$$\psi_I(x) = \psi_R(x) + \psi_T(x)$$

After passing into Region 2, the transmitted wave encounters the second part of the barrier. Using the same logic as before, we see that there is still a chance for the particle to appear in Region 3, where another transmitted wave is found. This is the tunnelling effect.
