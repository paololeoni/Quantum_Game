# Double Slit Experiment

The "double slit experiment" is a key step in understanding where quantum mechanics arises from and to understanding the concept of the quantum state of the system.

## Young's Experiment (1801)

In 1801 Thomas Young demonstrated that light behaves like a wave with the following experimental setup.

The setup consists in a wall with two narrow slits and an absorber screen that can detect, at each point of the screen, the intensity of the incident light. What characterizes the wave behavior of light is the distribution of intensity across the screen, which forms an interference pattern (c). If we now repeat the experiment with a source of electrons, we get the same interference pattern on the absorber screen; however, this seems strange because if we think to electrons as microscopic balls, we are led to think that the distribution we should observe should be like this:

By the way, in this case we talk about probability because we measure how many electrons have hit out of the total of each point on the screen. $P_1$ is the probability of an electron to pass through the first slit, while $P_2$ is the probability to pass through the second slit; the total probability we should observe is the sum of the two: 

$$P_{12} = P_1 + P_2$$

Thinking to electrons as microscopic balls we are also led to think that each electron either goes through slit 1 or it goes through slit 2. Yet, as said, what we observe is very different from what we expected, so we need to explain this. When electrons are fired one by one, each still adds to the interference pattern, as if every electron were passing through both slits at the same time. Hence, we have to experimentally verify if this is true.

## Which-Path Detection

As shown in this figure, to our electron apparatus we add a very strong light source, placed behind the wall and between the two slits. So when an electron passes, however it does pass, on its way to the detector, it will scatter some light to our eye, and we can see where the electron goes. Here is what we see: every time we see an electron which hits the detector screen, we also see a flash of light either near slit 1 or near slit 2, but never both at once! The probability distribution we have on the screen corresponds to the classical sum of the two: $P_{12} = P_1 + P_2$. However, when we turn off the light, the interference pattern is restored.

This phenomenon suggests that when we look at the electrons the distribution of them on the screen is different than when we do not look. Maybe light "disturbs" electrons in some way. If we use "gentler" light, with lower frequency, perhaps we can avoid disturbing the electrons so much. By repeating the experiment with this light, we can't actually say from which slit the electron has gone through because of the large wavelength of our light. However, the surprise is that we notice the interference pattern on the screen!

## Conclusion

Our conclusion to the experiment is that if one has a piece of apparatus which is capable of determining whether the electrons go through slit 1 or slit 2, then one can say that it goes either through slit 1 or slit 2. But, when one does not try to tell which way the electron goes, when there is nothing in the experiment to disturb the electrons, then one may not say that an electron goes either through slit 1 or slit 2.
