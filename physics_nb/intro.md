## Welcome

This interactive textbook provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics. Through a combination of theoretical explanations, mathematical formulations, and interactive Python examples, you'll explore the fascinating world of quantum physics.

## What You'll Learn

This book covers the essential foundations of quantum mechanics:

- **Wave-particle duality** through the famous double-slit experiment
- **Quantum superposition** and the mathematical framework of quantum states
- **Measurement theory** and the role of observation in quantum systems
- **Quantum entanglement** and its implications for information processing
- **Quantum tunnelling** and barrier penetration effects

## How to Use This Book

Each chapter in this book combines:

- ðŸ“– **Theory**: Clear explanations of quantum mechanical concepts
- ðŸ§® **Mathematics**: Step-by-step derivations using proper notation
- ðŸ’» **Code Examples**: Interactive Python simulations and visualizations
- ðŸŽ¯ **Practice**: Exercises to test your understanding

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this book, you should have:

- Basic knowledge of **linear algebra** (vectors, matrices)
- Familiarity with **complex numbers**
- Some exposure to **calculus** and **differential equations**
- Basic **Python programming** (helpful but not required)

## Interactive Features

This book is built with Jupyter Book, which means you can:

- Run code examples directly in your browser
- Modify parameters and see results in real-time
- Download individual chapters as Jupyter notebooks
- Access the complete source code on GitHub

## Getting Started

Navigate through the chapters using the sidebar menu. We recommend reading them in order, as each chapter builds upon concepts from the previous ones.
