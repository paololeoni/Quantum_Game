    "## Double Slit Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"double slit experiment\" is a key step in understanding where quantum mechanics arises from and in understanding the concept of the quantum state of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1801 Thomas Young demonstrated that light behaves like a wave with the following experimental setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"images/Screenshot_2025-09-17_163549.png\" alt=\"Double slit setup\" width=\"60%\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup consists of a wall with two narrow slits and an absorber screen that can detect, at each point of the screen, the intensity of the incident light. What characterizes the wave behavior of light is the distribution of intensity across the screen, which forms an interference pattern (c). If we now repeat the experiment with a source of electrons, we get the same interference pattern on the absorber screen; however, this seems strange because if we think of electrons as microscopic balls, we are led to expect the following distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"images/Screenshot_2025-09-17_165022.png\" alt=\"Classical expectation\" width=\"25%\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we talk about probability because we measure how many electrons hit each point on the screen out of the total. $P_1$ is the probability of an electron passing through the first slit, while $P_2$ is the probability of passing through the second slit; classically the total probability would be the sum:  \n",
    "$P_{12} = P_1 + P_2$  \n",
    "Thinking of electrons as microscopic balls we are also led to think that each electron either goes through slit 1 or slit 2. Yet, experimentally, what we observe is very different; each electron, even when sent one at a time, contributes to an interference pattern—as if it passed through both slits.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test this idea we try to determine “which path” the electron takes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"images/light.png\" alt=\"Which-path detection\" width=\"55%\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "We add a very strong light source placed behind the wall and between the two slits. When an electron passes on its way to the detector, it scatters light so we can see where it goes. Observation: every time an electron hits the detector screen we see a flash either near slit 1 or slit 2—never both. The distribution on the screen now corresponds to the classical sum $P_{12} = P_1 + P_2$. When we turn off the light, the interference pattern is restored.\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests that observing (measuring) the path alters the outcome. Perhaps the light “disturbs” the electrons. If we use gentler (lower frequency, longer wavelength) light, we can no longer accurately tell which slit the electron passed through; in that case the interference pattern reappears.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** If the apparatus is capable of determining whether electrons go through slit 1 or slit 2, then we obtain outcomes consistent with “either slit 1 or slit 2” and no interference. When we do not (and cannot) determine the path, and nothing in the experiment disturbs the electrons, we may not say the electron went through only one slit—the interference pattern emerges."

    "# Superposition\n",
    "\n",
    "From the double-slit experiment we are led to think that what truly characterizes the state of the physical system is the probability distribution of the possible outcomes. We then need some practical mathematical tools to describe the states that characterize our physical system. From our experiment, these tools should be exclusive and exhaustive: each of them corresponds to a distinct result of a measurement (exclusive) and their entire set corresponds to all possible results (exhaustive).\n",
    "\n",
    "A particular state x of the system is described by a symbol, namely a \"ket\", represented by the notation $\\ket{x}$ (Dirac notation). In the double slit experiment, the measurement of the electron through slit 1 or slit 2 can be described by two basis states:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\ket{+}$ corresponds to the electron passing through slit 1  \n",
    "- $\\ket{-}$ corresponds to the electron passing through slit 2  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we don't measure the electrons, the system can be in a general **superposition** of the two states, which is a linear combination:\n",
    "$$\\ket{\\psi} = \\alpha \\ket{+} + \\beta \\ket{-}$$\n",

    "We have seen that a closed quantum system will evolve according to a unitary evolution operator. However, there must come a time that the experimentalist will need to check some kind of result. In order to check, we need the experimentalist equipment (an external physical system), which will check \"what is happening\".\n",

    "**Measurement postulate:**  \n",
    "Quantum measurements are described by a collection $\\{M_m\\}$ of *measurement operators*. These are operators acting on the state space of the system being measured. The index $m$ refers to the measurement outcomes that may occur in the experiment. If the state of the quantum system is $\\ket{\\psi}$ immediately before the measurement then the probability that result $m$ occurs is given by:\n",
    "$$p(m) = \\bra{\\psi} M^\\dagger_m M_m \\ket{\\psi}$$\n",

    "$$\\ket{\\psi'} = \\frac{M_m \\ket{\\psi}}{\\sqrt{\\bra{\\psi} M^\\dagger_m M_m \\ket{\\psi}}}$$\n",
    "The measurement operators satisfy the completeness equation:\n",
    "$$\\sum_m M^\\dagger_m M_m = I$$\n",
    "The completeness equation expresses the fact that probabilities sum to one:\n",
    "$$1 = \\sum_m p(m) = \\sum_m \\bra{\\psi} M^\\dagger_m M_m \\ket{\\psi}$$\n",
    "This equation being satisfied for all $\\ket{\\psi}$ is equivalent to the completeness equation. However, the completeness equation is much easier to check directly, so that’s why it appears in the statement of the postulate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this is the broadest definition, it is not as intuitive as we would like. In addition, it is not the common framework when we talk about measurements. As a result, we will present the special case that is the most commonly used, which is the *projective* or *von Neumann* measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Projective Measurement:** For a given orthonormal basis $B = \\{\\ket{\\varphi_i}\\}$ of a state space $\\mathcal{H_A}$ for a system $A$, it is possible to perform a projective measurement on system $\\mathcal{H_A}$ with respect to the basis $B$ that, given a state\n",
    "$$\\ket{\\psi} = \\sum_j \\alpha_j \\ket{\\varphi_j},$$\n",
    "outputs a **label $i$** with **probability $|\\alpha_i|^2$** and **leaves the system in state $\\ket{\\varphi_i}$** (the state “collapses” to $\\ket{\\varphi_i}$). Moreover, a projective measurement can be described by an observable $M$ with spectral decomposition\n",
    "$$M = \\sum_m m P_m$$\n",
    "where $P_m$ is the projector onto the eigenspace of $M$ with eigenvalue $m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we want to define a projection operator in basis $B$, then $P_j = \\ket{\\varphi_j}\\bra{\\varphi_j}$. We can check that $P_j^\\dagger P_j = P_j$ and $\\sum_j P_j = I$ due to the completeness relation $\\sum_j \\ket{\\varphi_j}\\bra{\\varphi_j} = I$. Therefore, the collection $\\{P_j\\}$ is a projective measurement, consistent with the postulate defined previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can notice that $\\alpha_j = \\braket{\\varphi_j|\\psi}$ since $\\ket{\\psi} = \\sum_j \\ket{\\varphi_j}\\braket{\\varphi_j|\\psi}$. Additionally,\n",
    "$$|\\alpha_i|^2 = \\alpha_i^* \\alpha_i = \\braket{\\psi|\\varphi_i}\\braket{\\varphi_i|\\psi} = \\bra{\\psi} P_i \\ket{\\psi} = \\bra{\\psi} P_i^\\dagger P_i \\ket{\\psi} = p(i),$$\n",
    "which means that the probability of getting the outcome $\\ket{\\varphi_j}$ is $|\\alpha_j|^2$. After the measurement, the state collapses to $\\dfrac{P_m \\ket{\\psi}}{\\sqrt{p(m)}}$.\n",

Einstein disliked this phenomenon, interpreting it as if information traveled instantaneously—but no usable faster-than-light signaling occurs."
